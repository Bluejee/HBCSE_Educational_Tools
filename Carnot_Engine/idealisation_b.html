                    <li id="intro_1" style="padding-bottom: 2%;">We have previously concluded that the
                        ideal heat engine would have a
                        piston that moves between hot and cold sources, eliminating the irreversibility encountered
                        during combustion.</li>
                    <li id="intro_2" style="display: none;padding-bottom: 2%;">In addition to the piston movement, other
                        processes also
                        take place within the system.</li>
                    <li id="intro_3" style="display: none;padding-bottom: 2%;">To achieve the most ideal and efficient
                        heat engine, it is
                        essential that all processes
                        occurring within the system are reversible.</li>
                    <li id="intro_4" style="display: none;padding-bottom: 2%;">To ensure that our system is indeed ideal
                        and to uncover any
                        non-ideal processes, let us solve
                        some questions related to the system's behavior and efficiency.</li>

                        <li id="question1" style="display: none;"> There is a mechanical process that converts
                            mechanical
                            energy into thermal energy, which cannot be fully regained. Can you identify this process
                            and
                            suggest a solution to overcome this issue? </li>
                        <li id="question2" style="display: none;"> Heat exchange is necessary for the gas in the piston
                            to expand and contract in-order for the engine to do work. However, not all processes of
                            heat exchange are
                            reversible. For maximum efficiency, it is necessary that the process be reversible. Can you
                            suggest a solution to
                            ensure reversibility in the heat exchange process?</li>
                        <li id="question3" style="display: none;"> The isothermal expansion and compression of the gas
                            in the piston in the Carnot cycle takes place at the temperature of the heat source and
                            sink. In order to achieve maximum efficiency, it is necessary to match the temperature of
                            the gas in the piston with the temperature of the heat source or sink. What is the process
                            for changing the temperature of the gas in the piston in a reversible manner? Can you
                            suggest a solution that ensures maximum efficiency in the Carnot cycle?</li>

                        <li id="answer1" style="display: none;">Friction! <br>Friction can cause irreversibility in the
                            cycle
                            and reduce the efficiency of the engine. Therefore, having a piston without friction is
                            essential for the Carnot engine to achieve the maximum efficiency possible.
                        </li>
                        <li id="answer2" style="display: none;">A solution to ensure reversibility in the heat exchange
                            process is to perform the heat exchange isothermally. This means that the process should
                            happen slowly enough to maintain a constant temperature, so that the heat exchange is
                            reversible. for this we use heat sources and sinks that can provide infinite energy and
                            ensure that the heat baths are maintained at constant tempratures.</li>
                        <li id="answer3" style="display: none;">To change the temperature of the gas in the piston in a
                            reversible manner, an adiabatic process must be used. An adiabatic process is a process in
                            which there is no heat transfer between the system and its surroundings. This can be
                            achieved by having a thermally insulated piston placed on an insulating stand, so that the
                            heat transfer between the gas
                            and the surroundings is minimized.</li>

            <p id="conclusion" style="display: none;"> Gerat!<br> We now have an Ideal Heat Engine. This is called the
                <b>Carnot Engine</b>.<br>
                The Carnot engine is a theoretical model that represents an ideal heat engine. It is made up of a
                frictionless piston that moves between two heat baths at different temperatures. The heat baths provide
                infinite energy, and their temperatures are maintained constant. The piston is perfectly insulated from
                the environment and has a perfectly conducting base. The engine operates in a thermally isolated system,
                with no energy exchange with the surroundings. The Carnot engine operates through a series of reversible
                isothermal and adiabatic processes, allowing it to achieve the maximum possible efficiency.<br>

                Let us now understand how it works
